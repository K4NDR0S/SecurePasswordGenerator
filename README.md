# SecurePasswordGenerator
It's a small project created in half hour which i made coz i needed password generator to create more advanced passwords for my 
more important accounts.

If anyone want to use it then feel free to clone respository and add it as your web browser extension.

I'm reccomending using some password menager to save your passwords and use different passwords for other accounts coz why not.

Interface looks very easy:

1-  U can write how long your password should be (6-50 char)

2-  U can add or remove special marks (some sites don't like passwords with them)

3-  Just click generate how many times you want

4-  U can copy password to clipboard by just clicking on it

NOTES:

-sometimes password ill not be showed in display - it's coz sometimes it ill generate special mark at beginning, but don't worry 
it's not a bug, u can still hover it and click to copy - u ill just have more unique password

-i'm not thinking of upgrading this extension coz it's works as should but if i ill in the future then i ill write what's added here
